# Python 1-Week Crash Course 🐍

Tracking my daily progress learning Python from beginner to advanced.
This repository contains my hands-on practice, exercises, and mini-projects.

---

## 📅 Day 1 — Python Basics
**Topics learned:**
- What Python is and how it works
- Variables and data types
- Input and output
- Running Python scripts from terminal
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)

**Programs written:**
- `hello.py` – First Python program
- `calculator.py` - Simple calculator (basic operations)

---

## 📅 Day 2 — Conditionals & Logic
**Topics learned:**
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Comparison operators
- Logical flow and condition ordering
- Debugging syntax vs logical errors
- Reading Python error messages

**Programs written:**
- `even_odd.py` – Even or odd number checker
- `age_checker.py` – Age category classifier (Child, Teen, Adult, Senior)
- `grade_calculator.py` – Grade calculator
- `login_system.py` – Simple login authentication system


**Key lessons:**
- Python checks conditions top to bottom
- Order of conditions matters
- Indentation is critical in Python

## 📅 Day 3 — Loops & Iteration
**Topics learned:**
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `range()`
- `break` and `continue`
- Loop-based problem solving

**Programs written:**
- `print_numbers.py` – Printed numbers 1 to 10
- `multiplication_table.py` – Generated multiplication table
- `sum_of_numbers.py` – Calculated sum from 1 to 100
- `while_loop_example.py` – Basic while loop counter
- `guessing_game.py` – Number guessing mini game
- `skip_even_numbers.py` – Skipped even numbers using continue

**Key lessons:**
- Loops reduce repetition
- `break` stops a loop
- `continue` skips current iteration
- Infinite loops must be controlled carefully

## 📅 Day 4 — Data Structures
**Topics learned:**
- Lists (indexing, append, remove)
- Tuples (immutable sequences)
- Sets (unique values)
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Choosing the right data structure

**Programs written:**
- `lists_basics.py` – Practiced list operations
- `tuples_example.py` – Worked with immutable data
- `sets_example.py` – Removed duplicates using sets
- `dictionary_example.py` – Accessed and modified dictionary values
- `student_marks.py` – Calculated total and average marks
- `word_counter.py` – Counted word frequency using dictionary

**Key lessons:**
- Lists are ordered and changeable
- Tuples are fixed and safer for constant data
- Sets automatically remove duplicates
- Dictionaries are powerful for structured data



## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 3.14
- VS Code
- PowerShell
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Goal
By the end of this crash course, I aim to:
- Write clean, readable Python code
- Understand core Python concepts
- Build small real-world projects
- Use GitHub to track learning progress
